I am Jason Kong, a 3rd-year undergrad student in the CSE department at UC San Diego, working under the guidance of Professor. Tajana Rosing. My research focuses on LLM systems. To hear frequent updates and research ideas on my end, follow me on [ùïè](https://jasonkongie.com/x). 

**Current Research**
======
I am currently engaged in cutting-edge research in hyper-dimensional computing (HDC), processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, and compression methods for large language models (LLMs), under the supervision of [Professor Tajana ≈†imuniƒá Rosing](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/) at the [PRISM center](https://prism.ucsd.edu/) and [SeeLab](http://varys.ucsd.edu/).

**Projects and Publications**
======
- **TinyAgentQuantization-aware Model Compression and Adaptation for On-device LLM Agent Deployment**
  - We introduce a novel LLM edge deployment solution to automatically fine-tune and compress domain-specific LLMs with up to 8x memory saving and inference speedup with minimal performance loss. This work will be presented at the ICML 2024 ES-FoMo-II workshop.
