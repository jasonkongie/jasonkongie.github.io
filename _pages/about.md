What's up! I'm Jason, a 3rd-year undergrad studying computer engineering at UC San Diego. I am currently working under the supervision of [Professor Hao Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haozhang/) @ [Hao AI Lab](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/home/) and [Professor Tajana ≈†imuniƒá Rosing](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/) @ [SeeLab](http://varys.ucsd.edu/). I am currently involved with a several cutting-edge LLM research, more specifically on LLM evaluation, compression, and KV-caches. 

**Why Research?**
======
*My Values and Attributes*:
Foresight and initiative are two key attributes that I practice every waking second. I channel my foresight into choosing the right problems to solve, and I fuel my initiative by understanding the importance of my work. 

*My Community*:
A big part of what makes research so enjoyable for me is belonging to a wonderful research community and having friendships with my smart PhD colleagues. If you‚Äôd like to chat, feel free to connect with me on [ùïè](https://jasonkongie.com/x).

**Projects and Publications**
======
- **TinyAgentQuantization-aware Model Compression and Adaptation for On-device LLM Agent Deployment**
  - We introduce a novel LLM edge deployment solution to automatically fine-tune and compress domain-specific LLMs with up to 8x memory saving and inference speedup with minimal performance loss. This work was presented at the ICML 2024 ES-FoMo-II workshop.
